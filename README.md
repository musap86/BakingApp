# Project Overview

Created an app to view video recipes that incorporated media loading, verifying user interfaces with UI tests, integrated third party libraries and provided a complete UX with home screen widget.

* Part of the Android Developer Nanodegree Program

You will productionize an app, taking it from a functional state to a production-ready state. This will involve finding and handling error cases, adding accessibility features, allowing for localization, adding a widget, and adding a library.

## Why this Project?

As a working Android developer, you often have to create and implement apps where you are responsible for designing and planning the steps you need to take to create a production-ready app. Unlike Popular Movies where we gave you an implementation guide, it will be up to you to figure things out for the Baking App.

## What Will I Learn?

In this project you will:
*	Use MediaPlayer/Exoplayer to display videos.
*	Handle error cases in Android.
*	Add a widget to your app experience.
*	Leverage a third-party library in your app.
*	Use Fragments to create a responsive design that works on phones and tablets.

## App Description

Your task is to create a Baking App that will allow Udacity’s resident baker-in-chief, Miriam, to share her recipes with the world. You will create an app that will allow a user to select a recipe and see video-guided steps for how to complete it.

The recipe listing is located [here](http://go.udacity.com/android-baking-app-json).

The JSON file contains the recipes' instructions, ingredients, videos and images you will need to complete this project. Don’t assume that all steps of the recipe have a video. Some may have a video, an image, or no visual media at all.
One of the skills you will demonstrate in this project is how to handle unexpected input in your data -- professional developers often cannot expect polished JSON data when building an app.

## Sample Mocks

Here are some sample mocks that you can refer to as you build your app. Make sure your app functions properly on tablet devices as well as phones. ([PDF version](https://go.udacity.com/android-baking-app-mocks-pdf))
